# How to start the frontend (Next.js)

1. In a new terminal, go to the frontend directory:
   cd frontend
2. Install dependencies (if not done):
   npm install
3. Start the frontend in development mode:
   npm run dev

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3001 (or 3000 if backend is not running on 3000).

If you need to change the API URL, set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL in a .env.local file in the frontend directory.
